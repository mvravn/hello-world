# hello-world
My first and traditional repository!

How y'all doing?

I'm the founder of uniforum.dk, a community-platform for university students in Denmark. Basically, it is just a forum, but I'm using it to create an effect. Currently crossing my fingers and hoping it'll take off.

I've got a master in sociology with the BA in philosophy and economics. My subject is communities; the social mechanisms that make them tick and continue ticking.

My humble mission is to just make the world better by creating communities where there are none, but there should.

Having said that, I want to know everything time permits when it comes to servers and coding and the interwebs - so sooner or later, I'd end up here.
